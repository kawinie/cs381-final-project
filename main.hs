    Imperative 
    Basic data types and operations. You should provide at least boolean values and integers; you may want to include floating point numbers as well.

    Conditionals.
    
    Recursion/loops.

    Names (imperative/functional languages only).
    
    Procedures/functions with arguments (or some other abstraction mechanism). You should provide a way to factor out repeated code and give it a name so that it can be reused. For imperative/functional languages, you must decide what kind of parameter passing scheme to use, which weâ€™ll discuss in class. (Passing arguments is trivial for stack-based languages since arguments are passed on the stack!).
